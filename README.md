# guids

Generate *n* GUIDs from the command line.

## Install

Download and build the thing, then either add the binary directory to your `PATH` or follow my super cool guide to setting up [a kind of `/usr/bin` for Windows](http://stegriff.co.uk/upblog/mimic-usr-bin-in-windows)

## Usage

Print 1 new GUID to the console:

	guids
	
Print a specific number of new GUIDs to console:

	guids 5
	
You can of course redirect this to a file

	guids 5 > myGuids.txt
